testing https://coverwrite.vercel.app/create to write me a good CL

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the IT Systems Support Analyst position at AESC US LLC in Florence, SC. Having followed AESC's innovative work in battery technology for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, I am eager to contribute to a company that is committed to a sustainable, zero-emission future.

My background in [mention degree if applicable] has provided me with a solid foundation in IT principles and practices. I have hands-on experience in desktop support, Active Directory administration, Office 365 management, and mobile device management. As demonstrated by my self-directed ARENA curriculum, drastically improving my skills of technical AIS and displaying autonomy, I am confident in my ability to troubleshoot technical issues and provide timely support to end-users.

In my role at Access to Medicines Initiative, I demonstrated the ability to iterate quickly, prioritize producing working models in short time frames, and adapt autonomously, by conducting data analysis and producing output with only occasional check-in meetings, even without a direct data background. This experience, combined with my technical skills, makes me well-equipped to handle the responsibilities of this position.

I am particularly drawn to AESC's focus on continuous improvement and its collaborative work environment. As the recipient of the Outstanding Economics Senior award, I am equipped to communicate effectively and work collaboratively with cross-functional teams. I am also excited about the opportunity to contribute to AESC's expansion in the United States and its commitment to local communities. The opportunity to develop macroeconomic indicators in an AI economy, as a FIG fellow under Anton Korinek, further demonstrates my ability to succeed in similar research.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn more about the IT Systems Support Analyst position and how my skills and experience can benefit AESC.

Sincerely,

Leopold Brown

Kind of sucks, and doesn't actually put much info into writing a good cover letter
## other stuff

dont really seem to be a ton of other existing projects out there for writing cover letters, I think I might just have to research AI scaffolding/prompt designing for improving writing and then put it all together into the API
# writing improvement scaffoldidng/prompting
break stuff down into smaller parts

use models and examples

give example of structured output

## summary

from most stuff i've seen, I probably have a pretty good idea of the type of prompting structure that needs to happen. Onto planning phase to get a good estimate.

# chatgpt api costs
scales linearly with input and output tokens, so having a reduced context window will linearly reduce the cost. Probably good to use the cheap one to condense and summarize, then pass the smart model smaller context and have it write the response.
